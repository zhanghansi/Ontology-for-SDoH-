That can be problematic if plans are changed during their execution. There are however implicit contingencies for protocols that an agent has in his mind that can be considered part of the plan, even if the agent didn&apos;t have them in mind before. Therefore, a planned process can diverge from what the agent would have said the plan was before executing it, by adjusting to problems encountered during execution (e.g. choosing another reagent with equivalent properties, if the originally planned one has run out.)</obo:IAO_0000116>

A plan may be modified, and details added during execution. For a given planned process, the associated realized plan specification is the one encompassing all changes made during execution. This means that all processes in which an agent acts towards achieving some 
objectives is a planned process.</obo:IAO_0000116>

        <rdfs:comment xml:lang="en">An interesting question is whether there must be another participant who is the &quot;educator&quot;.  Some might object that many people are &quot;self taught&quot;.  A real case of being self taught is the first person who learned to play a stringed instrument, or to spin a ball on the top of a finger.  There was no previous information about that.  The ICEs acquired are via one&apos;s sensory systems (vision, proprioception, auditory, etc.).

On the other hand, in the case of those who are self-taught by reading books or watching videos, or acquiring some other form of ICEs concretized outside their brain, one argument might be that the author of those ICEs somehow &quot;plays a role&quot; in the education, although they cannot participate in the education process itself (If I read Aristotle, and through repeated application of the information I acquire through doing so, develop the ability to write better ontology definitions, surely Aristotle did not actively participate in my particular education process, although he did influence it in a very real way).</rdfs:comment>
